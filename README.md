Dragon BLITZ

A game for the Dragon 32, from the July 1983 issue of Dragon Data's official Dragon User magazine for the Dragon 32.

Typed in and tested for your convenience.

To load into the emulator XRoar, use the Load... menu and select the DBLITZ.BAS file. Then enter CLOAD in the emulator. Type RUN. Type RUN again once that has completed.

Keys are ENTER to drop bomb and UP arrow key to fly upwards (while fuel lasts! Each time you press up consumes one of your 50 units of fuel), and DOWN arrow to land.

Good luck!

NB: I did not write this game - it was written by Damian Clancy - but reproduced it here for posterity as it was the first type-in game I ever entered as a kid on a computer :-)

UPDATE:

The Tandy CoCo .cas and .wav files for loading into a vanilla CoCo2 are now uploaded also!
